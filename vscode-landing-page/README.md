# VS Code Landing Page

A clean and simple landing page inspired by **Visual Studio Code** UI, built using **HTML and CSS**.  
This project demonstrates frontend design skills by replicating VS Code’s look for practice and portfolio.

## Features

- Minimalistic design inspired by VS Code’s official website  
- Header with logo and navigation links  
- Hero section with promotional text and call-to-action buttons  
- Static desktop layout only — **not responsive**  
- Pure HTML and CSS with no JavaScript
